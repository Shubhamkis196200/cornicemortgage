  <p class="mb-4">Choosing between an FHA and conventional loan is one of the most important decisions first-time homebuyers make. Both have distinct advantages and requirements that can significantly impact your homeownership journey.</p>
  <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">Understanding FHA Loans</h2>
  <p class="mb-4">FHA loans are backed by the Federal Housing Administration and designed to help buyers with less-than-perfect credit or smaller down payments achieve homeownership. They've helped millions of Americans buy their first homes since 1934.</p>
  <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-3">FHA Loan Requirements</h3>
  <p class="mb-4">Credit score minimum: 580 for 3.5% down payment, or 500-579 with 10% down. Debt-to-income ratio up to 43% (sometimes 50% with compensating factors). Property must be primary residence and meet FHA appraisal standards.</p>
  <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-3">FHA Down Payment Options</h3>
  <p class="mb-4">As low as 3.5% with a 580+ credit score. Down payment can come from gifts, grants, or employer assistance programs. This accessibility makes FHA loans popular with first-time buyers who haven't had time to save 20%.</p>
  <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-3">FHA Mortgage Insurance</h3>
  <p class="mb-4">FHA requires both upfront (1.75% of loan amount) and annual mortgage insurance premiums (0.45-1.05% depending on loan amount, LTV, and term). Unlike conventional PMI, FHA MIP stays for the life of the loan if you put down less than 10%.</p>
  <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">Understanding Conventional Loans</h2>
  <p class="mb-4">Conventional loans aren't backed by the government. They're offered by private lenders and follow guidelines set by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. They offer more flexibility but typically require stronger financials.</p>
  <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-3">Conventional Loan Requirements</h3>
  <p class="mb-4">Credit score minimum: Usually 620, though 740+ gets best rates. DTI ratio typically maxes at 45% (50% in some cases). Higher standards for employment history and documentation. More stringent appraisal requirements.</p>
  <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-3">Conventional Down Payment Options</h3>
  <p class="mb-4">As low as 3% for first-time buyers through certain programs. Standard is 5-20%. Putting down 20%+ avoids PMI entirely. Down payment requirements are stricter for investment properties (typically 15-25%).</p>
  <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-3">Conventional PMI</h3>
  <p class="mb-4">Required if down payment is less than 20%. Costs 0.5-1.5% of loan amount annually. Can be removed once you reach 20% equity through payments or appreciation. Some lenders offer lender-paid PMI with slightly higher rates.</p>
  <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">Side-by-Side Comparison</h2>
  <p class="mb-4">Credit score: FHA accepts 580+; Conventional prefers 620+. Down payment: FHA 3.5%; Conventional 3-5%. Mortgage insurance: FHA has upfront + annual (often permanent); Conventional has annual (removable at 20% equity). Property limits: FHA has regional loan limits; Conventional has conforming limits ($766,550 in most areas for 2026).</p>
  <p class="mb-4">Interest rates: FHA often slightly lower rates but higher total costs due to MIP. Conventional rates vary more by credit score. Property standards: FHA has strict property condition requirements; Conventional more flexible. Debt ratios: FHA allows higher DTI; Conventional stricter. Processing time: Similar (30-45 days typically).</p>
  <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">Who Should Choose FHA</h2>
  <p class="mb-4">Credit score below 620. Small down payment saved (3.5%). Higher debt-to-income ratio. First-time homebuyer. Purchasing in expensive market where FHA limits work. Property meets FHA standards. Plan to stay long-term (to offset MIP costs).</p>
  <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">Who Should Choose Conventional</h2>
  <p class="mb-4">Credit score 700+. Can put down 10-20%+. Low debt-to-income ratio. Want to remove PMI eventually. Purchasing property that might not meet FHA standards. Buying above FHA loan limits. Want more property type flexibility. Might refinance or move within 5-10 years.</p>
  <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">Cost Comparison Example</h2>
  <p class="mb-4">$300,000 purchase, 5% down ($15,000), 30-year term. FHA at 6.0%: Upfront MIP $4,987, monthly payment $1,829 (includes $237 MIP), total paid over 30 years $658,440. Conventional at 6.25%: Monthly payment $1,858 (includes $143 PMI), PMI drops after ~7 years, total paid $642,000. The conventional loan saves $16,440 despite the higher rate.</p>
  <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">Refinancing Considerations</h2>
  <p class="mb-4">FHA to Conventional: Makes sense once you have 20% equity to eliminate MIP and get better rate. FHA Streamline: Simplified refinance for current FHA borrowers, no appraisal required. Conventional refinance: Generally easier with good payment history and equity.</p>
  <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">Special Situations</h2>
  <p class="mb-4">Condos: Both allow, but FHA requires HOA to be FHA-approved. Multi-unit (2-4 units): FHA allows with owner-occupancy; Conventional requires larger down payment. Fixer-uppers: FHA 203(k) rehab loans; Conventional HomeStyle loans. Student loans: FHA counts 0.5% of balance or actual payment; Conventional uses actual payment. Self-employed: FHA slightly more flexible; both require 2 years history. Gift funds: Both allow but FHA more lenient on sources.</p>
  <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">Common Misconceptions</h2>
  <p class="mb-4">Myth: FHA is only for low-income buyers. Reality: Anyone meeting requirements can use FHA, regardless of income. Myth: Conventional always has better rates. Reality: FHA rates often competitive, especially for lower credit scores. Myth: You need perfect credit for conventional. Reality: 620 minimum, though higher scores get better rates.</p>

  <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">The Application Process</h2>
  <p class="mb-4">Both require similar documentation: tax returns, pay stubs, bank statements, employment verification, credit check, debt information. Timeline: 30-45 days for both. Appraisal: FHA stricter on property condition; conventional more flexible. Closing costs: Similar ranges (2-5% of loan amount).</p>
  <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">Long-Term Considerations</h2>
  <p class="mb-4">Staying 30 years: FHA MIP costs accumulate significantly; conventional might save money long-term even with higher initial rate. Staying 5-10 years: Differences smaller; lower rate matters more. Building equity: Conventional with 20% down builds equity faster (no insurance costs). Home appreciation: Both benefit equally from market gains.</p>
  <p class="mb-4">The right choice depends on your specific situation. Calculate both scenarios, consider your timeline, and choose the option that best fits your financial picture and goals.</p>`;

  <p class="mb-4">Your credit score is one of the most important factors in mortgage approval and rate determination. Even a 20-point increase can save you thousands of dollars over the life of your loan.</p>
  <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">Understanding Credit Scores</h2>
  <p class="mb-4">FICO scores range from 300-850. Mortgage lenders typically use FICO scores from all three bureaus (Experian, Equifax, TransUnion) and use the middle score. 740+: Excellent, best rates. 700-739: Good rates. 680-699: Average rates. 660-679: Higher rates. 640-659: Significantly higher rates. Below 640: Limited options, highest rates.</p>
  <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-3">What Makes Up Your Score</h3>
  <p class="mb-4">Payment history (35%): Most important factor, late payments hurt significantly. Credit utilization (30%): Percentage of available credit you're using. Length of history (15%): Average age of accounts. Credit mix (10%): Variety of account types. New credit (10%): Recent applications and inquiries.</p>
  <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">Check Your Credit Reports</h2>
  <p class="mb-4">Get free reports from AnnualCreditReport.com from all three bureaus. Review for errors: wrong accounts, incorrect balances, accounts that aren't yours, paid-off debts showing as unpaid, duplicate accounts. Dispute any errors in writing with supporting documentation. Bureaus must investigate within 30 days.</p>
  <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">Pay Down Credit Card Balances</h2>
  <p class="mb-4">This is the fastest way to boost your score. Target under 30% utilization overall, under 10% is ideal. Pay before statement close date for faster impact. Don't close paid-off cards—this reduces available credit. Consider balance transfer to lower-rate card if it helps you pay faster.</p>
  <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-3">Strategic Payment Example</h3>
  <p class="mb-4">If you have $10,000 in credit limits and $5,000 in balances, you're at 50% utilization. Paying down to $3,000 (30%) could increase your score 20-40 points. Paying to $1,000 (10%) could add another 10-20 points.</p>
  <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">Make All Payments On Time</h2>
  <p class="mb-4">Set up automatic minimum payments for everything. Pay bills as soon as you receive them. Set calendar reminders. Use autopay for all recurring bills. Even one 30-day late payment can drop your score 60-110 points. The impact lessens over time but stays on your report for 7 years.</p>
  <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">Don't Apply for New Credit</h2>
  <p class="mb-4">Each hard inquiry can drop your score 5-10 points. Multiple inquiries in short time signal risk to lenders. Stop applying for new credit 6-12 months before mortgage shopping. Exception: mortgage rate shopping within 14-45 days counts as single inquiry.</p>
  <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">Keep Old Accounts Open</h2>
  <p class="mb-4">Closing accounts reduces available credit (increasing utilization) and lowers average account age. Keep oldest accounts open even if unused. Put small recurring charge on old cards to keep them active. Closing your oldest account could drop your score significantly.</p>
  <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">Address Collections and Charge-Offs</h2>
  <p class="mb-4">These severely damage your score. Options: Pay in full and request deletion (not guaranteed). Settle for less and get written agreement. Let old debts fall off after 7 years (doesn't apply to judgments). Don't pay old collection just before mortgage application—this can refresh the date and hurt more.</p>
  <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">Become an Authorized User</h2>
  <p class="mb-4">Ask family member with excellent credit to add you as authorized user on their old, well-managed account. Their positive history can boost your score quickly. You don't need access to the card, just to be on the account. Choose accounts with: long history, low utilization, perfect payment history.</p>
  <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">Diversify Credit Mix</h2>
  <p class="mb-4">Having different types of credit (cards, auto loan, installment loan) can help. Don't open new accounts just for this—the inquiry and new account hurt more than mix helps. If you only have credit cards, your existing accounts will age and help over time.</p>
  <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">Request Credit Limit Increases</h2>
  <p class="mb-4">Higher limits lower utilization without paying down balances. Ask for soft inquiry increases (no hard pull). Many issuers allow online requests every 6 months. Don't spend the extra credit—just let it improve your utilization ratio.</p>
  <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">Use Experian Boost and UltraFICO</h2>
  <p class="mb-4">Free programs that add positive payment history for utilities, phone, streaming services. Can increase score immediately by 10-20+ points. Only affects Experian score but worth doing. Sign up at Experian.com/boost.</p>
  <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">Handle Student Loans Strategically</h2>
  <p class="mb-4">Keep federal loans in good standing. Consolidation can help with multiple late payments. Rehabilitation can remove default status. Income-driven repayment reduces monthly obligation (lenders count actual payment or 1% of balance).</p>
  <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">Rapid Rescore for Mortgage</h2>
  <p class="mb-4">Available through your lender during mortgage process. Updates credit report with proof of positive changes (paid off balance, corrected error). Can boost score in 3-5 days instead of 30-60. Typically costs $25-50 per bureau. Worth it if close to qualifying for better rate tier.</p>
  <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">Timeline for Credit Improvement</h2>
  <p class="mb-4">Immediate (3-5 days with rapid rescore): Pay down high balances, correct errors, become authorized user. 1-3 months: Payment history improvements, utilization optimization. 3-6 months: Consistent positive habits, hard inquiry impact fades. 6-12 months: Significant score improvements, age of accounts increases. 2+ years: Negative items lose impact, strong positive history established.</p>
  <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">What NOT to Do</h2>
  <p class="mb-4">Don't close credit cards. Don't max out cards before applying. Don't apply for new credit. Don't co-sign loans for others. Don't ignore bills or let accounts go to collections. Don't pay off very old collections right before applying. Don't consolidate all debt onto one card (high utilization). Don't dispute accurate negative information—it doesn't work.</p>
  <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">The Impact of Score Improvements</h2>
  <p class="mb-4">On a $300,000 loan: 640 to 680 score: Save ~0.5% rate = $90/month, $32,400 over 30 years. 680 to 720 score: Save ~0.5% rate = $90/month, $32,400 over 30 years. 720 to 760 score: Save ~0.25% rate = $45/month, $16,200 over 30 years.</p>
  <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">Working with a Mortgage Lender</h2>
  <p class="mb-4">Be honest about credit issues upfront. Ask for guidance on specific improvements. Some lenders offer credit improvement programs. Get pre-qualified (soft pull) to see where you stand. Wait until score is optimized for formal pre-approval.</p>
  <p class="mb-4">Improving your credit takes time and discipline, but the payoff is substantial. Start early, be consistent, and use our tools to track your progress toward your homeownership goal.</p>`;
